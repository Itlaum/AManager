# AManager
by Latium - pre-dev

## Main Informations
This project is about creating a manager able to set-up architectures easily and quickly, to be able to integrate it to the hosting solution we use (It could result to one or multiple dockers, or setup raspery pi or remote server automatically, etc). It has three steps :
 - Creating the architecture and specifying the needed arguments for each new machines
 - Give the arguments for the implementation plan
 - Follow the implementation plan to implement the custom architecture
The different things should be dynamical, and editable with JSON and script files coresponding to new machines possibilities, or to new implementation plans.

## Working plan
- V0.1.0 : Code structure ended
- V0.2.0 : Objectification of machines ended
- V0.3.0 : Objectification of implementation plans ended
- V0.4.0 : Basic machines, implementation plans and GUI made
- V0.5.0 : Debugging script available && first debugging ended
- V0.6.0 : Extraction of machines throught their object ended
- V0.7.0 : Implementation trough implementation plans object ended
